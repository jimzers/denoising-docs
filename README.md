# Denoising Dirty Documents with Autoencoders and Stackers and CycleGANs

Using autoencoders and stackers to denoise dirty documents

Attempt 1: use autoencoder to denoise document

Attempt 2: use stacker to combine various models, eg. median filtering, edge detection, adaptive thresholding, and past autoencoder to make smarter model

Attempt 3: use CycleGAN to generate more data to train on
